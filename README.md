# Prelude
This is a step-by-step tutorial for those of you who only want to use Fika for PERFORMANCE, and coop is only optional.

I will include both a tutorial for _WAN_ and for _LAN_ setups.

LAN setup is first, WAN setup will come after. Feel free to skip if you want to use WAN.

## Prerequisites [LAN]
Open your Windows Firewall Advanced Security app.
